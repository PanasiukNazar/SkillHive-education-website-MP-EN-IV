                        We take steps to protect your personal data and
                        implement appropriate technical and organizational
                        measures to protect it from unauthorized access,
                        disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we strive

                    </p>

                    <h2>Your Rights</h2>

                        please contact us, and we will promptly update it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Deletion</h3>

                        processing of your personal data in certain
                        circumstances, such as if you challenge the accuracy of
                        the data or object to our processing activities.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>
                        You have the right to request a copy of your personal
                        data in a structured, commonly used, and
                        machine-readable format. This allows you to transfer
                        your data to another service provider if you wish.
                    </p>

                    <h3>5. Objection to Processing</h3>

                        your request unless we have strong grounds for
                        processing the data.
